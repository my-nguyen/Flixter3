This Flixter3 app is a copy of Flixter2
I tried to use JetPack navigation to go from MainActivity to DetailActivity but fails because error:
"A YouTubePlayerView can only be created with an Activity which extends YouTubeBaseActivity as its context."

Currently in Flixter3, activity_main.xml contains only a FragmentContainerView
All main logic is in MainFragment; MainActivity is just empty
MainFragment navigates to DetailFragment, which contains all detail logic, but derives from Fragment
However, as the error above indicates, the container cannot be a Fragment and must be an Activity
that derives from YouTubeBaseActivity
